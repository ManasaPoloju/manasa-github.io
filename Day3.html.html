<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language" target="self"> markup language </a> for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="self"> web browser </a>. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="self"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" target="self"> scripting languages </a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="self"> JavaScript </a>, a programming language.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine" target="self"> render </a> the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" target="self"> semantically </a> and originally included cues for its appearance.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target="self"> HTML elements </a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldset" target="self"> interactive forms </a> may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document" target="self"> structured documents </a> by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links , quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets" target="self"> angle brackets </a>. Tags such as &lt; img &gt: and &lt; input &gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt; p &gt; and &lt; /p &gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" target="self"> scripting language </a> such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" target="self"> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </a>, former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="self"> CSS </a> standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="self"> HTML5 </a>, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt; canvas &gt; element, together with JavaScript.
